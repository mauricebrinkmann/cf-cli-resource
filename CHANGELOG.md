# Change log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 2.24.0 - Unreleased

### Added

- `push` command now supports directly passing application manifest yaml to the `manifest` param (see updated example in [README](README.md#push)).  The resource will intelligently figure out if you specified a file (original behavior) or yaml and will act accordingly.

### Changed

- Updated to [cf cli v6.53.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.53.0)
- Updated to [cf7 cli v7.2.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v7.2.0)

## 2.23.0 - 2020-12-06

### Added

- `bind-route-service` command now supports the `configuration` param for specifying service-specific configuration parameters, thanks to a PR by [BartoszKaszewczuk](https://github.com/BartoszKaszewczuk)

### Changed

- Previously when doing a `push` command with `manifest` and `environment_variables` params, the existing manifest file would be modified in-place to include the environment variables. We now modify a copy of the original manifest and leave the original alone. This is all internal to the cf-cli-resource and should not affect any existing pipelines!

## 2.22.0 - 2020-10-11

### Added

- Introduced new tests (see `spec` folder) using the [shellspec](https://shellspec.info/) BDD testing framework. The existing home-grown test framework in the `itest` folder has served this project well, but it's time to move on to something better. Over the upcoming releases, we'll slowly start converting more of the `itest` tests to the newer `spec` tests.
- `unbind-route-service` - Unbind a service instance from an HTTP route, thanks to a PR by [JHjava](https://github.com/JHjava)

### Changed

- `push` command now supports specifying multiple `buildpacks`, thanks to a PR by [tenjaa](https://github.com/tenjaa). The original `buildpack` option is now deprecated and superceded by `buildpacks`.
- Resource and test executions are now isolated from each other thanks to setting their own unique `CF_HOME` locations.

## 2.19.0 - 2020-06-29

### Added

- Introduced experimental support for `cf7` cli! This is enabled by configuring `cf_cli_version: 7` globally on the resource source configuration.

### Fixed

- The `environment_variables` handling introduced for the `push` command introduced in v2.18.1 wasn't properly placing the `env` node at the application level (it was placing it at the deprecated global level) with only one application in the manifest but no `app_name` declared. This has been corrected and the test case updated to properly check for this condition.

### Changed

- Major changes to `zero-downtime-push` command!!! The command has been refactored to no longer depend on the deprecated [autopilot](https://github.com/contraband/autopilot) plugin and now provides a "hand crafted" zero downtime push experience and supports `vars` and `vars_files` arguments, thanks to a PR by [shyamz-22](https://github.com/shyamz-22). It also now supports `docker_image`, `show_app_log` on failed pushes, the `no_start` flag, and `staging_timeout` and `startup_timeout` params. The `zero-downtime-push` integration tests have also received a major overhaul to ensure a seamless transition.
- `push` command now supports the `show_app_log` option to output app logs after a failed push (use with `app_name` option)
- `bind-route-service` command now supports the `path` option (used in combination with `hostname` and `domain` to specify the route to bind), thanks to a PR by [shyamz-22](https://github.com/shyamz-22)!
- We use Alpine Linux as the base image for `cf-cli-resource` when it runs inside of Concourse. With Alipine `v3.8` headed to [End of Support on 2020-05-01](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux:Releases) it was time to update to Alpine `v3.11` which should keep us up-to-date till 2021-11-01.
- Removed `autopilot` cf cli plugin (see changes to `zero-downtime-push` command)
- Updated `yq` cli to version 3.2.1

| yq         |    [3.3.2](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/tag/3.3.2)     |

## 2.18.1 - 2020-03-31

### Fixed

- When `push`ing an app with `environment_variables` without a manifest, we create a temporary manifest that contains the `env:` attribute. This was being done at the global attribute level, resulting in cli deprecation warnings: `Deprecation warning: Specifying app manifest attributes at the top level is deprecated. Found: env.` This is now fixed by creating a manifest with the `env:` attribute properly set at the application level. No more deprecation warnings (thanks to a PR by [@destasys](https://github.com/destasys))

### Changed

- Replaced all direct calls to `cf` cli with a `cf::cf` wrapper function. This is the first pass at being able to specify which version of the cf cli you want to use (in preparation for testing the [cf7](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloading-the-v7-beta-cli) version of the cli)

### Changed

- `push` command now supports setting `environment_variables` (thanks to a PR by [@lbenedix](https://github.com/nedenwalker))
- `set-env` command now supports setting multiple `environment_variables`. This deprecates the original `env_var_name` and `env_var_value` params.
- Updated `yq` cli to version 3.2.1

## 2.17.0 - 2020-02-27

This release introduces some major changes to the project structure. The `cf-cli-resource` has come a long way since its humble beginnings in early 2017 and it was about time to do some spring cleaning. Thankfully our test cases have ensured that we were able to make these changes with confidence. Check out the rest of the release notes for all the details.

### Added

- N/A

### Fixed

- The `create-users-from-file` command now logs a warning (instead of an error) if the `Username` value is not set (since that's not a failing condition).

### Changed

- Updated to [cf cli v6.49.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.49.0)
- `add-network-policy` and `remove-network-policy` commands now support the `destination_org` and `destination_space` params for targeting a destination app in a different org and/or space.
- `create-service` command now supports the `broker` param to disambiguate if you have two services with the same name.
- Renamed `assets` folder to `resource`. This makes it simpler to locate scripts whether we are running tests locally or in a Docker image.
- Renamed `cf_*` functions to `cf::*` to follow the "package" naming convention.
- Moved all supporting function libraries to respective `resource/lib` and `itest/lib` folders.
- Refactored `resource/out` to invoke resource commands from separate files (see `resource/commands` folder). This should make adding new commands much cleaner and easier.

## 2.16.0 - 2020-01-27

### Added

- `cf_home` param for supplying a `CF_HOME` folder which (in this initial release) allows for passing on a previously configured `.cf/config.json` file for CF API authentication (thanks to a PR by [@lbenedix](https://github.com/lbenedix))

### Changed

- `push` command now supports the `domain` param, thanks to a PR by [@vixus0](https://github.com/vixus0)

### Added

- Validation tests for validating error exit codes
- logging library

### Changed

- Completed [Operation Global Cleanup](https://github.com/nulldriver/cf-cli-resource/projects/1#card-23927144) to cleanup how global vars are used in the test scripts.

## 2.15.0 - 2019-06-27

### Fixed

- `enable-service-access` and `disable-service-access` used a very mis-leading `service_broker` param to represent the name of the marketplace service to enable/disable. So, the `service_broker` param is now deprecated and is superseded by the new properly named `service` param.

### Added

- `create-buildpack` - Create a buildpack
- `update-buildpack` - Update a buildpack
- `delete-buildpack` - Delete a buildpack

### Changed

- Updated to [cf cli v6.45.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.45.0)
- Refactored `cf_functions.sh` to utilize the new `cf curl --fail` option for better error api error handling
- Quite a bit of test code cleanup

### Changed

- `zero-downtime-push` command now supports the `stack` option

### Fixed

- Fixed `zero-downtime-push` where it had some problems with environment variables that were multi-line or started with a hyphen
- The optional `port` and `protocol` options for `add-network-policiy` are now really optional, thanks to a PR by [@rs017991](https://github.com/rs017991)

## 2.9.1 - 2018-11-18

### Fixed

- `command_file` previously only worked by specifying an absolute file path. This is fixed to correctly support relative paths and the tests have been updated accordingly, thanks to a PR by [@renbeynolds](https://github.com/renbeynolds)
- Fixed `create-user-provided-service` example for specifying a `route_service_url`, thanks to a PR by [@eruvanos](https://github.com/eruvanos)
- `run-route-tests` now properly test if an app is mapped to a route

### Added

- `share-service` command - Share a service instance with another space
- `unshare-service` command - Unshare a shared service instance from a space
- `rename` command - Rename an app
- Source configuration now supports `origin` for `username` & `password` authentication
- Source configuration now supports `client_id` and `client_secret` for authentication
- `command_file` support - You can now configure `command` or `commands` in an external yaml file, thanks to a PR by [@senglin](https://github.com/senglin)

### Changed

- Test cleanup now deletes orphaned service brokers from previously failed tests
- With the authentication changes in this release, the `cf_login` function was getting a bit overloaded, so it's now gone in favor of separate `cf_api`, `cf_auth_user`, and `cf_auth_client` functions
- Updated to [cf cli v6.40.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.40.0)
- Updated to [autopilot cf plugin v0.0.8](https://github.com/contraband/autopilot/releases/tag/0.0.8)

## 2.4.1 - 2018-02-09

### Fixed

- `cf_trace: true` no longer messes up `cf` calls that are intended to capture the json output inside scripts. For now, we set `CF_TRACE=false` for all `cf` calls where we need to capture the output. I think there is a way to redirect the `CF_TRACE` output, but I couldn't figure it out with the way we do stdout and stderr redirects in the `out` script. Until then, please note that you won't see the trace info _every_ `cf` command used in the script.

## 2.4.0 - 2018-02-08

### Added

- We now have a dedicated Cloud Foundry instance to use for integration testing (thanks Pivotal!!). This should help turn-around PRs and issues a little faster.
- Support `cf_trace`, `cf_dial_timeout` and `cf_trace` configurations for source and command params.
- `unbind-service` command - Unbind a service instance from an app

### Changed

- Updated docs to clarify the use of logical names for `put` steps.
- `delete-service` command now supports `wait_for_service` param for deleting asynchronous services.
- Refactored integration tests to default to PCF Dev for local testing while allowing for overriding by exporting env vars before running the test script.
- Added `test` job to pipeline to run the integration tests after the Docker image is built.
- Refactored service creation/binding/deletion tests to better focus on synchronous and asynchronous services.

### Fixed

- `wait-for-service` command errors if the service does not exist.

### Fixed

- Fixed `enable-service-access` and `disable-service-access` both now properly treat `plan` and `access_org` as optional, thanks to a PR by [@legnoh](https://github.com/legnoh)
- Docs for `enable-service-access` and `disable-service-access` have been corrected to reference `service_broker` argument name (was incorrectly set to `service`).

### Added

### Changed

- `create-user-provided-service` command no longer fails if there is an existing _user provided service_ by the same name. **NOTE:** This is a departure from how the normal `cf cups ...` command works as it normally fails with an error:

- cf_login skip_ssl_validation param now defaults to `false`.

### Changed

- Integration test now parameterizes the cf connection settings so we can target different cf installs.
- Integration test now cleans-up previously failed tests.
